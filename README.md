## De-Beeping-Audio-by-Spectrogram-Analysis
Removing beeping background sound from source by analysing the STFT spectrogram

The file DeBeeper.py , takes the x.wav input file which has a beep in the background and converts it into its spectrogram using STFT.

######STFT code is written from scratch and no library is used.

The spectrogram is then analysed and the beep manually removed.

The STFT process is then reversed and the de-beeped file created.
